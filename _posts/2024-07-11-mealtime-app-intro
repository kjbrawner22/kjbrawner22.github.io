## MealTime App Intro

My family has been struggling with making, scheduling and planning nutritious meals since the birth our baby girl. I also had a health scare where I was in the hospital for almost 2 weeks, and that has taxed my wife tremendously. I intend to fix that in the short-term by regaining my strength and helping with more cooking and cleaning, but my mid-to-long term solution for this particular pain point is to fix our planning woes with my mediocre web app skills.

My desired features for this app (subject to change) are:

### Needs
- Weekly views for planning, meal prepping (cook ahead), and just-in-time cooking (cook and eat now or assemble leftovers)
- Scheduling and notifying about various phases of the process. Sample examples:
  - Weekly planning and grocery list compilation will happen *on* tuesday evenings at 7pm
  - Weekly grocery store trip or delivery will happen *by* thursday evenings at 6pm
  - Notifications for long lead-time recipes (e.g. marinading, taking food out of freezer, sourdough prep, etc.)
 - Simple recipe book with ingredient scaling, searching (maybe tags will be good enough for this?)
 - Built-in tags for recipes related to key functionality. i.e. meal-prep friendly or not

### Wants
- Theme night planning and providing dropdown list of stored recipes to automatically place in the correct day
- Leftover theme that'll pre-populate with options based on user-supplied input of what meals generated leftovers (and how much)
  - My family typically had 1 or 2 hodge-podge nights where leftovers just got reheated and thrown on the table. Quick and dependable. I want to be able to build that in to the schedule easily.
- Meal prep reheat instructions from fridge or freezer (user-supplied).
  - I struggle with the best way to reheat and I never remember what I did last time. Microwave, oven, air fryer, stove??? Combination?! Ugh... Attaching it to a recipe that has been tagged as meal-prep friendly will enable easy recall if i don't make it for a while after.

I'm sure there will be more, but I want to keep it simple for now. I've had good luck with flask web apps in the past for my prototyping, so that's my plan. And shoutout to the indispensable [Miguel Grinberg Flask WebApp tutorial](https://blog.miguelgrinberg.com/post/the-flask-mega-tutorial-part-i-hello-world). I go through it everytime I make a new one, so that'll be no different here. Obviously there will be some changes, but I'll be utilizing it as a basis.

Stay tuned on my progress!
