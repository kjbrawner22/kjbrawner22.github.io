## Introduction

I've been looking to install a dedicated linux setup on my personal laptop (Surface Pro 2017) for some time now. In the past, I've dual-booted Windows and Ubuntu on my desktop, but I don't particularly like that for my laptop as I only have a 256GB SSD on this. I also really enjoy the Surface Pro tablet features that make quick sketches and note-taking easy, so replacing Windows entirely isn't on the table either.

Instead, I bought one of these handy-dandy 1TB portable SSDs from Amazon and installed a bootable Ubuntu partition on it. Now, with Ubuntu's fantastic hardware interoperability, I can plug my development environment in basically wherever I go. It was super simple but let me show you how I did just that.
