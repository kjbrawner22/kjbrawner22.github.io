I'm Kenny Brawner, a software engineer with lots of thoughts that most people probably don't care about. On the off-chance that somebody out there finds them useful, I want to document it. Hell, I forget what I do all the time, so maybe that person is me, and maybe that's enough.

I am a full-time software engineer for a small DoD contracting company called [Parry Labs](https://parrylabs.com/), but my interests far exceed the military world.

At the end of the day, I enjoy solving problems and helping people. It's a bonus when my creative juices are flowing enough to create solutions that keep my head own screwed on (Lord knows I need all the help I can get).

I'm always open to answering questions or helping folks/businesses out who need it. Feel free to reach out! The best way is through [LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/kennybrawner/) or [email](mailto:kjbrawner22@gmail.com). Standby for a resume page and/or services page that might shed a little more light on if we're a good fit to work together.
